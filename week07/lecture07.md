# Today

1. What is a framing device?
1. Choices: 
  * data informed vs. data driven
  * interactive vs. static
  * guided vs. unguided
  * audience

notes:
So we'll talk a bit about framing devices and how apply them to data stories

We'll discuss a few choices we need to make when selecting framing devices.  

1. is our data story data-informed or data driven?
1. do we want our story to be interactive or static? or hybrid -- a mix of these two?
1. how does causality work? do we want our user to be guided through our story? or explore on their own?
1. Who is your audience? what design choices will need to be made to support this audience?

## Framing Devices

Think of a video game, or a movie, where someone was introduced to something.

notes:
so, at least for me, I find framing devices to be a little abstract, so lets start with an example

think a bit about when you started reading a book, playing a video game, etc -- usually there is some element 
of introduction -- concepts, ideas, setting, are introduced

---

## Framing Devices Example

<iframe seamless="seamless" style="width: 100%; border: none; display: block; max-width: 768px; height: 600px;" src="https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/embed/cc875f97-6042-4c9b-861a-614c32cc08f2?autoplay=false?rel=0"> </iframe>

notes:
for example, from this great movie waynes world

** play clip**

this was a quick clip, but it in what follows, Wayne introduces himself and then tells us a bit about where he lives and his general life there by giving us *context* for the rest of the movie

---

## Framing Devices Example

<iframe width="896" height="504" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fmeb-f4pthA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

notes: 
in this example, will see the intro from alfred hitchock presents, which was the introduction to every one of the episodes of the show 

*play clip*

so, every week you would see this clip and alfred hitchock would introduce the stories for that week -- this provides *stability* for the viewer, i.e. they know what to expect after this little intro would run, that they were going to see a mystery and/or a spooky story

---

## Framing Devices Example

<iframe width="896" height="504" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oEgO16JaW4Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

notes:
this is an intro to a video game called "Half Life"

one thing to see is that in this case you can move your head around, but you can't leave the train

another thing to see is that for the first two there was a strong element of 4th wall breaking -- the characters "step out" of the story to give us information, but here, accept for the credits, you are "in" the story for the whole time

but what you are getting, instead of an explaination is an *orientation* to the game -- an overview of the place and some background about the world around you

---

## Framing Devices

What do framing devices provide?

 * Context -- Wayne's exposition
 * Stability -- Alfred Hitchcock's weekly introduction
 * Orientation -- Half Life's train trip
 
notes:
in each of these cases, the framing device played an important role in giving the user (1) the context of the story, (2) an understanding of what kind of story was going to be taking place, i.e. a sense of stability and/or (3) an overview of the setting and context of the story

## What is a framing device?

A technical-ish definition:

"A Framing Device (or Frame Story) is a narrative technique wherein a writer surrounds their primary story with a secondary one. In other words, they frame their main story with another story.

Framing Devices lead the audience into the larger narrative, oftentimes by having characters in the outer story tell the primary story in some way."

[ScreenCraft](https://screencraft.org/2021/09/15/everything-you-need-to-know-about-framing-devices/)

notes:
disclaimer, this is not my field BUT here's a good enough definition from ScreenCraft *read*

OR

If a piece of art is the story, the frame would be the "framing device" (hence the name!).

notes:
another way to think about this in an even broader sense is that if you have a picture of artwork, this is the story, then the frame holding that artwork is this "framing device" that is used to place your story within

## Framing Devices - beyond introductions

notes:
so, the original examples we saw where for introductions to movies/video games, but framing devices can be "holders" of the full story as well

</div>

notes:
one older example is the "choose your own adventure" if anybody remembers those :)

in these, you would start off reading like a normal book, but then depending on what choices you make, you are told to go to different pages to continue the story and there by "choosing" your own ending

here you can think of the framing device as these set of choices, and the physical turning of pages to different parts of the book depending on these different choices

</div>

notes:
a much newer example is netflix's bandersnatch in which you are watching an episode of blackmirror, but you are allowed to make decisions that determine the outcome

in this case, part of the framing device is the remote that you click that determines these choices

---

## Framing Device Choices

  * data informed vs. data driven
  * interactive vs. static
  * guided vs. unguided
  * audience

notes:
when we are chosing how to frame our data story to our audience, there are several choices we have to make 

or sometimes these choices are determined by the kind of story we want to tell and the medium of telling

---

## Informing versus Driving

Do you want your audience to be able to recreate your input data?  To make inferences?  Or is it appropriate to focus on conveying broad ideas, without one-to-one mapping of information to visualization?

Our stories must be *honest*.

How can we relate this to thinking about inductive as opposed to deductive storytelling?

## Finding the story

 > "But the numbers keep on circling me..."

Let's talk about explaining things.

notes:

 * what is a framing device? put in a definition
 * reminder of data characters
 * twine: framework for interactive fiction, bandersnach was storyboarded in this, also choose your own adventure
 * remote/book -- tacktile sentation and control -- example of framing device, path through data
 * map -- this tells you where you are, w/rt data like bike trails, restaurants
 * HIV viz -- data informed vs. gapminder which is data driven (can reproduce data from graphs)
 * inductive vs deductive storytelling
 * framing for us: true or THE truth (data informed, data driven) AND control vs. leading viewer on a path
 * another example: how games teach you to play them (Myst!), record scratch meme, breaking the 4th wall
 
 * maybe start with "choose your own adventure" and bandersnatch
 * have formal definition
 * then some introduction examples
 * "state dependent learning" -- learning something within a specific context as an analogy in psychology
 
 * narrative: you go tell someone, or canned conversations in a game
 * navigable: user is in control, more invested in some cases
 * hybrid: spectrum!
 
FOR navigable
 * think about: how much control do you want to give your user? ex: GDS gives SOME control (over graphs) but not over which graphs are produced
 * causality? control? connection
 * static stories
 * hybrid examples -- bloomberg, interactives, maybe on bbc? (order is fixed) figures in the sky is great! -- framing discussion is the intro paragraph, order is whatever we choose -- causality means that we don't need to know one thing before the next
 * probably have the full list, but only look at these 2 (mention nixon sonification and link to twotone: https://twotone.io/)

## How do we tell stories?

 * Teller
 * Tale
 * Told

---

## Data Stories

Where does the data fit into this?

Where does the interaction fit into this?

## Framing Devices: Context

## Framing Devices: Orientation

---

## Storytelling Form

 * Narrative
 * Navigable
 * Hybrid

---

## Style of Story: Navigable

Do we give the person control?  How much control?  What do we need to retain?

<ul>
 <li class="fragment"><b>Causality</b>: Do we want to start <i>en media res</i>? Are we just a bunch of events that happen to occur?</li>
 <li class="fragment"><b>Control</b>: How many degrees of freedom do we provide? When does it become confusing?  Is it sequential, random access, or a hybrid?</li>
 <li class="fragment"><b>Connection</b>: Does the experience (the teller) enable a connection between the data (the tale) and the viewer (the told)?</li>
</ul>

---

## Style of Story: Static

Things sit there.  People can explore with their eyes, but the reference points never change under their feet.

These can be effective, but can also be less visceral.

---

## Style of Story: Hybrid

A large-scale progression, coupled with intermediate diagrams that may be navigable.

---

## Style of Story: Examples

 * [Bloomberg 50](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2019-bloomberg-50/)
 * [Figures in the Sky](http://www.datasketch.es/may/code/nadieh/) (and [write-up](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/portfolio/figures-in-the-stars))
 * [Selfie City](http://selfiecity.net/)
 * [Letter Frequency](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/gallery/frequency-letters)
 * [Legend of Nixon](https://twotone.io/examples/legend-of-nixon/)

---

## Designing Your Story

 1. What medium will you use?
    * How do you want people to "consume" it?
    * What are the pre-requisites?
    * What do you need to do to prepare it?
 2. What should it look like?
    * How "risky" should it be?
    * Is there a "visual language" you could use?
 3. Where are the dimensions?
    * What can change?
    * What can stay the same?
    * What can the audience control, and what can they not?

---

## You Can Do This

<p class="fragment">Yes, you can do this.</p>

<p class="fragment">Even the stuff that seems super technical and complicated.</p>

<p class="fragment">I wouldn't say this if it weren't true.</p>

---

## Resources

<ul>
<li class="fragment">There are tutorials out there.  Use these.</li>
<li class="fragment">Use templates.  Make them your own.</li>
<li class="fragment">Learn from others.  Ask questions.</li>
<li class="fragment">Find the fun things.</li>
<li class="fragment">Use stuff like <a href="https://iodide.io">iodide</a>, <a href="https://observablehq.com/">observable</a>, <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/">safari</a>, <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>, and especially <a href="https://glitch.com/">glitch</a>.
</ul>

---

## Choosing a Medium

 * Will you be there?
 * How constrained is your story?
 * What technical abilities do you have?
 * How does the data interact?

---

## Technical Choices for a Medium

(Besides the one we're going to use today!)

[Explorables explanations](https://explorabl.es/) has a collection of [tools](https://explorabl.es/tools/) we can explore.

[Kinetic Graphs](https://kineticgraphs.org/) allows you to define specific characteristics, thus enabling mathematical formulas to be manipulated.

[Observable](https://observablehq.com/) is a platform for exploring interactive notebooks, and is particularly well-suited to visualization and design projects.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is a straightforward way of creating HTML (or markdown) and placing it online.  This can include interactivity.

[Glitch](https://glitch.com/) is an environment for exploration of web development and applications which can have server-side components.

## Twine

Today we are going to use Twine.

Twine is a way to build interactive narratives in the browser, that can be
experienced and guided.  We will cover the very basics of Twine, including
navigation and variables, and then we will split into groups to discuss how we
might use this for data stories.
